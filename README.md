## A study on the Hailstone Sequence
The Hailstone Sequence, or "Collatz Conjecture" goes as follows:
1. Pick a whole number
2. If the number is even, divide by two. If it is odd, multiply by three and add one.
3. If you repeat this, it will eventually get to 1.

Some interesting problems occur in in the Collatz conjecture:
How big can a number get before it eventually goes to 1?
What numbers have the most steps?
Is it possible to start at one, and find the integer with the most steps?
